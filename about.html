        <p>
          I studied Physics for my bachelor and master's degree, where I was
          drawn to solving problems through research, although most often than
          not, only leads to new questions.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have assumed different roles in the past years, but being a
          researcher best describes all that I do. I have worked in the
          university as a science research specialist, co-founded a startup and
          currently leading its financial operations, and now, a web-developer
          student.
